### Languages & Techniques Used: 
- HTML (provided)
- CSS  (provided)
- JavaScript 
- Regular Expressions (Regex)

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files to add my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly. 

### Features:
- There is customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validation on name field, email, activity field, credit card number, zip code and cvv code.
- All fields are fully validated user input in real time and provide helpful error message when the user enters invalid informaiton .
- The form can not be submitted unless all required fields are correctly filled out. 

### Future Challenge
I would like to add the following feature:
-  Display an alert message ` "Thanks for registereting for Full Stack Conference! You are all set." ` when `submit` button is clicked after all required field are filled out.
